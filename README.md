Issues Fixed
-------------
	1. Don’t use Mixin without proper usecase
	2. Put transparencies in css file
    3. Load templates on Demand
	4. Put ‘#’ through router
	5. Try not to use Window or other globals
	6. Use _.each instead of for loops, go through all methods of underscore 
	7. Don’t put all the code in single file, organize the code into multiple files
